# EduSense AI – Learning Pattern & Academic Risk Intelligence System

## Overview
EduSense AI is an intelligent educational analytics system designed to help educators understand student learning behaviors, identify academic risk early, and provide personalized teaching interventions using Machine Learning.

The system transforms raw student behavioral and academic data into actionable classroom insights, enabling data-driven educational decision-making.

---

## Problem Statement
Students exhibit diverse learning patterns influenced by engagement, study habits, health, and social factors.  

Traditional classroom environments lack scalable tools to:
- Identify struggling students early
- Understand learning differences
- Provide personalized academic support

As a result, many students are recognized as at-risk only after poor academic performance.

---

## Proposed Solution
EduSense AI applies Machine Learning and Explainable AI techniques to:

- Discover student learning personas automatically
- Predict academic risk levels before examinations
- Explain performance-driving factors
- Recommend personalized teaching strategies
- Generate educator-ready intervention reports
